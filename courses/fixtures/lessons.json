        "content": "Pros of Python\r\nPython has many benefits that make it a go-to programming language to learn by beginner programmers.\r\n\r\n1. Beginner friendly\r\nPython is a programming language that is widely known for being beginner friendly. One of the main reasons why Python is considered easy to learn is its simple syntax. Python code is easy to read and understand, which makes it easier for beginners to write and debug code.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why this language is beginner-friendly is its versatility. Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from Python web development to data analysis and machine learning. This means that beginners can choose a domain that interests them and start learning Python in a context that is relevant to their interests.\r\n\r\nPython also has many resources, such as online tutorials, video courses, and interactive coding platforms. These resources provide step-by-step guidance and help you build your skills in a structured way.\r\n\r\n2. Well-supported\r\nPython has a vast and active community of developers, and is known for being friendly, welcoming, and supportive. You can find support in social media groups and online forums, regardless of the language that you speak.\r\n\r\nThe Python community is also very active in contributing to open-source projects. There are many open-source libraries and frameworks available in Python that are maintained by the community.\r\n\r\nWhen you learn a new language, it’s vital to have a community where you can ask questions to more experienced professionals and get their feedback.\r\n\r\n3. Flexible\r\nPython is a high-level language, which means that it is easy to read and write, with a focus on abstracting away low-level details and providing a higher level of abstraction. However, it is also a powerful language that can be used for complex projects.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why Python is so flexible is its extensive library of modules and packages. These libraries provide pre-written code that can be easily integrated into a project, saving developers time and effort. Additionally, Python can be used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing, among other applications.\r\n\r\nPython’s flexibility also comes from its ability to work with other languages. It can be easily integrated with languages like C++ and Java, allowing developers to use Python for specific tasks alongside other languages for other parts of a project.",

        "content": "Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.\r\n \r\nLists\r\nPython Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\r\n\r\nDictionary\r\nPython dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. \r\n\r\nTuple\r\nPython Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.\r\n\r\nDictionary\r\nIn Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by a ‘comma’.\r\nThe dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.\r\nValues in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.",
